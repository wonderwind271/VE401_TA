*Concept checking paper is first invented by previous VV186, 285, 286TA Leyang Zhang.  It is NOT mandatory. I design it for you to solidify the new concepts / knowledge you learn in VE401. All the questions are purely conceptual or calculation-based. You can do them right after the class each week, or use them as review materials before exams. Generally, the content in my concept checking paper covers more material than will be tested in exams, so it should be able to help you prepare for exams, or simply have a sound understanding of VE401. I donâ€™t provide answers for concept checking paper, because I want you to find the answer on slides, and fill in the blanks with your own understandings. If you are familiar with what you learn, you should be able to fill in each concept checking paper in 15 to 30 minutes.* 



**The concept checking paper 5 is related to topics in the statistics, including sample and data, point estimate**

1. What's the difference between probability theory and statistics theory?
2. If we want a sample to be treated as i.i.d random variable, the sample size should be (not too large/ as large as possible).
3. What's the percentiles and quartiles of a sample? What's IQR?
4. How to use The Freedman-Diaconis Rule to decide the bin width?
5. How to use Mathematica to draw histogram? If the given data doesn't have comma, how to deal with it?
6. How to determine whether a sample comes from normal distribution from the figure of histogram?
7. What's the inner fence and outer fence?
8. How to draw a boxplot? How to determine whether a sample comes from normal distribution from the figure of boxplot?
9. What's the meaning of statistic?
10. Point estimate is a method that use statistic to \_\_\____.
11. Describe the basic principle of moment estimate and maximum likelihood estimate.
12. How to evaluate whether an estimator is good or not?
13. What's sample variance? Is it an unbiased estimator for overall variance?
