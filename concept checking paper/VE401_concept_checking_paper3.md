*Concept checking paper is first invented by previous VV186, 285, 286TA Leyang Zhang.  It is NOT mandatory. I design it for you to solidify the new concepts / knowledge you learn in VE401. All the questions are purely conceptual or calculation-based. You can do them right after the class each week, or use them as review materials before exams. Generally, the content in my concept checking paper covers more material than will be tested in exams, so it should be able to help you prepare for exams, or simply have a sound understanding of VE401. I don’t provide answers for concept checking paper, because I want you to find the answer on slides, and fill in the blanks with your own understandings. If you are familiar with what you learn, you should be able to fill in each concept checking paper in 15 to 30 minutes.* 



**The concept checking paper 3 is related to continuous random variable and its numerical features. From my point of view, normal distribution is especially important. Please make sure you understand the concepts of normal distribution well.**

1. What's the definition of continuous random variable? What's the PDF of a continuous random variable?
2. What's the probability of a continuous random variable on a single point, i.e., $$P[X=x]$$ ？
3. What's the definition of $$E[X]$$ and $$Var[X]$$ ?
4. We know the PDF of $$X$$ is $$f_{X}(x)$$, what's the expectation of $$\varphi(X)$$ ? Suppose the expectation exist.
5. Write down the exponential distribution's PDF, CDF, m.g.f as well as the expectation and variance.
6. What's called the memoryless property of the exponential distribution?
7. Write down the gamma distribution's PDF, CDF, m.g.f as well as the expectation and variance.
8. Suppose $$X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$$ follows an exponential distribution with parameter $$\beta$$ , what's the distribution of $$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}X_i$$ ?
9. Write down the normal distribution's PDF, CDF, m.g.f as well as the expectation and variance.
10. Suppose $$X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$$, what's the standard normal distribution?
11. We know the PDF of $$X$$ is $$f_{X}(x)$$, and a function $$\varphi$$ is monotonic. Derive the PDF of $$\varphi(X)$$. 
12. In all kinds of statistic handbook we can always see a table called $$\Phi$$ table. What does it means? Why don't we derive a formula of $$\Phi(x)$$ and calculate it directly?
13. $$X\sim N(100,36)$$, calculate $$P[80\leq X\leq 115]$$
14. Write down the Chebyshev Inequality. The range it given out is much looser than normal distribution, so what's its advantage?
15. How to approximate binomial distribution with normal distribution? When should we use half-unit correction? What's the difference between approximating binomial distribution with normal distribution and Poisson distribution?
16. What's the central limit theorem?
17. Why do we suppose type-A uncertainty follows a normal distribution (in VP141 and VP241)?
