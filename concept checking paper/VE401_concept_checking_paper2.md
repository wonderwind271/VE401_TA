*Concept checking paper is first invented by previous VV186, 285, 286TA Leyang Zhang.  It is NOT mandatory. I design it for you to solidify the new concepts / knowledge you learn in VE401. All the questions are purely conceptual or calculation-based. You can do them right after the class each week, or use them as review materials before exams. Generally, the content in my concept checking paper covers more material than will be tested in exams, so it should be able to help you prepare for exams, or simply have a sound understanding of VE401. I don’t provide answers for concept checking paper, because I want you to find the answer on slides, and fill in the blanks with your own understandings. If you are familiar with what you learn, you should be able to fill in each concept checking paper in 15 to 30 minutes.* 



**The concept checking paper 2 is related to discrete random variable and its numerical features**.

1. What's random variable? What's the difference between variable and random variable?

2. What's discrete random variable?

3. Which important concept is abbreviated as "i.i.d"? 

4. If $X\sim B(10,0.3)$, then what's $P[X=6]$?

5. If $X_1\sim B(n_1,p), X_2\sim B(n_2,p)$, what's the distribution of $X_1+X_2$ ？

6. What's the probability density function(PDF) of Geometric distribution with parameter $p$ ?

7. Suppose $X\sim Geom(p_1)$, $X_1, X_2,\dots , X_n$ are $n$ i.i.d random sample of $X$, which kinds of distribution does the random variable $\sum\limits_{i=i}^{n}X_i$ follows? Hint: https://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/~horst/teaching/resources/ve401_summer17_ex02.pdf, ex 2.5

8. Does every random variable have expectation.

9. Suppose $X$ has PDF $f_X(x)$, and $Y=\varphi(X)$, what's $E[Y]$ (if exist)?

10. Express $Var[X]$ in terms of expectation.

11. Express the m.g.f of $X$, $m_X(t)$, in terms of expectation.

12. What's pascal distribution's PDF? 

13. Write down Poisson distribution's PDF, expectation and variance.

14. Explain how and when to approximate binomial distribution with Poisson distribution?

15. $X_1\sim \pi(\lambda_1),X_2\sim \pi(\lambda_2)$, what's the distribution of $X_1+X_2$ ? (note: $\pi(\lambda)$ means Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda$)
