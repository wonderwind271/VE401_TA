*Concept checking paper is first invented by previous VV186, 285, 286TA Leyang Zhang.  It is NOT mandatory. I design it for you to solidify the new concepts / knowledge you learn in VE401. All the questions are purely conceptual or calculation-based. You can do them right after the class each week, or use them as review materials before exams. Generally, the content in my concept checking paper covers more material than will be tested in exams, so it should be able to help you prepare for exams, or simply have a sound understanding of VE401. I don’t provide answers for concept checking paper, because I want you to find the answer on slides, and fill in the blanks with your own understandings. If you are familiar with what you learn, you should be able to fill in each concept checking paper in 15 to 30 minutes.* 



**The concept checking paper 1 is related to probability theory, roughly slide page 1-70**.

0. In your opinion, what’s "probability" and "statistics" based on the probability and
   statistics knowledge you have learnt in your life?  

1. I throw three coins. Suppose "H" means head and "T" means tail in one throw. 

   1. What's the sample space of this experiment?
   2. Define event $A$: "The last throw is different from the first throw". Write out the event in terms of set.

2. What's the mathematical definition of "probability"?

3. True or false? 

   1. Any subset of a sample space S is an event.
   2. It's possible to randomly, equally possibly pick a number from the set of $N$
   3. It's possible to randomly, equally possibly pick a number from the set of $R$
   4. It's possible to randomly, equally possibly pick a number from the set of $[0,1]$

4. Give an example to show that an "almost surely occurred" event may not always happen

5. What's the formula of total probability? What's the formula of Bayes’s Theorem?

6. Suppose a round of COVID test has 2% probability to report negative when you're infected, and 0.5% probability to report positive when you're not infected.

   1. Suppose the probability of getting infected by COVID-19 is 0.2% in your community, what's the probability for you to get infected if you get positive result?
   2. Generally speaking, for lack of medical resources, we often apply a mixed test. Ten pipes are mixed together and if the result is positive, all the ten people involved will have 2 extra individual test and they will be considered as infected if they get any of the test positive. What's the probability for you to get infected if you are considered as infected?

   ***(all the data in this problem are fabricated. This is not medical advice!)***

7. Persuade yourself with intuition that the conclusion of The Monty Hall Paradox(P68) is correct.

8. I have 3 card. One of them has red color in two sides, one has red in one side and black in the other. The third card has black color in two sides. Now I close my eye and randomly pick one card. I find that one side of this card is red. What's the probability that the other side is red?

9. There's 4 "(" and 4 ")", and for a random permutation of these 8 characters, what's the probability that it forms a "valid parentheses"?

10. For a 4-digit coded lock(from 0000-9999), what's the probability that two digits are equal, but other digits are not equal? For example, 0026 is OK but 3377 is not OK.
