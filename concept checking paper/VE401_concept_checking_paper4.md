*Concept checking paper is first invented by previous VV186, 285, 286TA Leyang Zhang.  It is NOT mandatory. I design it for you to solidify the new concepts / knowledge you learn in VE401. All the questions are purely conceptual or calculation-based. You can do them right after the class each week, or use them as review materials before exams. Generally, the content in my concept checking paper covers more material than will be tested in exams, so it should be able to help you prepare for exams, or simply have a sound understanding of VE401. I don’t provide answers for concept checking paper, because I want you to find the answer on slides, and fill in the blanks with your own understandings. If you are familiar with what you learn, you should be able to fill in each concept checking paper in 15 to 30 minutes.* 



**The concept checking paper 4 is related to all the rest things in probability theory. The topics are multivariate random variables and their numerical features, the law of large numbers, the hypergeometric distribution, transformation of random variables and reliability.**

1. What's the meaning of joint density function, marginal density and conditional density  of a discrete multivariate random variable?
2. When can the joint density function be completely determined by the product of the marginal density?
3. What's the definition of the expectation of discrete multivariate random variable $$X$$ ?
4. What's the definition of continuous multivariate random variable? 
5. How to calculate $$E[\varphi(X)]$$ when we know the joint density function of $$X$$ ? $$X$$ can be either a discrete or continuous multivariate random variable.
6. What's the definition of the covariance of $$X$$ and $$Y$$, $$Cov[X,Y]$$ ?
7. Write down the covariance matrix of multivariate random variable $$X$$. What's its property?
8. What's Pearson correlation coefficient of $$X$$ and $$Y$$, $$\rho_{XY}$$ ?
9. can $$\rho_{XY}=0$$ leads to the independence of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ ?
10. Write down the fisher transform of $$\rho_{XY}$$.
11. For a bivariate  normal distribution $$X=(X_1,X_2)$$, can $$\rho_{X_1X_2}=0$$ leads to the independence of $$X_1$$ and $$X_2$$ ?
12. Which of the following statement is true? Are the other two statements all wrong(not covered in this course)? Suppose $$X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$$ a sequence of i.i.d random variables with $$E[X]=\mu, Var[X]=\sigma^2$$:
    1. $$\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}P[|\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}X_i}{n}-\mu|\leq\varepsilon]=1 $$ for $$\forall\varepsilon>0$$
    2. $$\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}X_i}{n}=\mu$$
    3. $$P[\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}X_i}{n}=\mu]=1$$

13. Derive the PDF of hypergeometric distribution by your own
14. The hypergeometric distribution is actually a \_\_\_\_ Bernoulli trials

​	i) i.i.d

​	ii) non identical but independent

​	iii) non independent but identical

​	iv) neither identical nor independent

15. What's the expectation and variance of a hypergeometric distribution?
16. Write down the function of transformation of variable. Derive the PDF of $$XY$$ when the PDF of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are known.
17. What's the relationship between chi-squared distribution and normal distribution?
18. Does chi-squared distribution has additivity?
19. Given the PDF of $$X$$ and $$Y$$, how to calculate the PDF of $$min\{x,y\}$$ and $$max\{x,y\}$$ ?
20. What's the mathematical relationship between failure density, reliable function and hazard rate?
