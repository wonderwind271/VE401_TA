*Concept checking paper is first invented by previous VV186, 285, 286TA Leyang Zhang.  It is NOT mandatory. I design it for you to solidify the new concepts / knowledge you learn in VE401. All the questions are purely conceptual or calculation-based. You can do them right after the class each week, or use them as review materials before exams. Generally, the content in my concept checking paper covers more material than will be tested in exams, so it should be able to help you prepare for exams, or simply have a sound understanding of VE401. I donâ€™t provide answers for concept checking paper, because I want you to find the answer on slides, and fill in the blanks with your own understandings. If you are familiar with what you learn, you should be able to fill in each concept checking paper in 15 to 30 minutes.* 



**The concept checking paper 6 is related to interval estimate**

1. What's a disadvantage of point estimate?
2. If $X\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, and $X_1, X_2, \dots , X_n$ are n i.i.d sample of $X$, the sample mean, $\overline{X}$ follows which distribution with what parameters?
3. What's the definition of $z_{\alpha}, \chi^2_{\alpha,n}, t_{\alpha,n}$ ?
4. When the overall variance is known(denoted as $\sigma^2$), what's the $1-\alpha$ two-side, upper, lower confidence interval of $\mu$?
5. When the overall variance is unknown, what's the $1-\alpha$ two-side, upper, lower confidence interval of $\mu$?
6. When the overall variance is unknown, what's the $1-\alpha$ two-side, upper, lower confidence interval of $\sigma^2$ ?
7. Suppose we calculated that the 95% two-side confidence interval for $\mu$ is $[10, 15]$, does that mean $P[\mu\in[10,15]]=0.95$ ?
