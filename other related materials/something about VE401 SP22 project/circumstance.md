## Some Circumstance of Unexpected Things

### Basic Circumstance of VE401 SP22 Project

In 2022 spring semester, professor Horst found many ( $\geq 4$ ) groups of team projects that involves plagiarism. Many groups' submissions have something similar or identical to previous (SP19) projects. As a result, all the students in these projects (students number $\geq 4*5=20$) are reported to Honor Council.

Unluckily, I'm involved in these cases too. I'm in project group 8. At the very beginning (in May), I do not know I'm reported to HC as well. The only thing I know is another group is reported (I think at that time many students in JI also know about that). And at that time I write an email to Horst talking about my opinion towards that case, as can be seen in the file [horst_mail_thread.txt](../horst_mail_thread.txt) .



### What had happened?

According to the report from Horst, 

> "These students are in project group 8. Section 3 of 'Spring 2022 - Group 8 - Term project report.pdf' appears to be very similar to Section 5 of 'Spring 2019 - Group 17 - Term project report.pdf'."

Yuqi Mai is responsible for all the plagiarism part. He copied this section.

(Luckily) he made many mistakes when copying this part, and I found it out before the report was submitted.

I was informed that I'm involved in the case on July 16, 2022, about 4 pm, 2 hours before my regular RC. As a result, I cancelled my RC this time immediately, and started preparing materials to defend myself. (It's indeed sort of irresponsible for me to cancel his recitation class 2 hours before the class. So, very sorry for that, but please understand that I was at a tough time).



### Communication with Horst

According to JI Honor Code, section 5 (Collaborative Group Work):

> Coursework involving collaboration within a group (e.g., lab reports, project reports, etc.) require that all members of the group whose name appears on the assignment are jointly and fully responsible for the entirety of the submitted work. If any section of the submission is found to violate the Honor Code, all group members whose name appears on the submission are equally and jointly liable for the violation. **An exception is possible, at the instructor’s discretion, if part of the work is clearly delineated as originating only from specific group members.**

I know this section quite well. It's one of the interview question when I apply to join honor council! So, I know the best thing I can do at that time is explain everything to Horst and ask him to give me an exception, otherwise I may be totally screwed up.

I have sufficient reasons to defend myself. I check everything my group members wrote, and for Mai Yuqi's part, I reformat the table to make it more professional, and I checked and find out his calculation error (actually "inherited" from the SP19 report, but I don't know at that time). I'm in good communication with the group, and I did literally everything I can do. So, there's no way I can find out Mai yuqi's plagiarism part if he didn't tell me.

Here's the [mail thread](explain_mail_thread.txt) that I communicate with Horst. I also write another ["essay"](explain.pdf) to state the reason. Both can be found in this folder. After that, Horst thought it was reasonable, and he agreed to give me the exception. As return, I give a make-up RC and record it.



### Honor Council Process

You know, I'm a member of honor council. Once the honor council start the investigation of my case, my position is suspended. Finally, I'm found innocent, together with other group members except Mai Yuqi. The memorandum for this case that I received is also attached [here](2207006_22SP_ECE4010J_Shuyu Wu_Yuqi Mai_Hanwen Zhang_Yuyang Chen_Hanlin Gao.docx) . My position in Honor Council is reinstated once after the innocent decision (about 5 minutes after the hearing). Notice that for honor council member, it's strictly forbidden to show investigated students' memorandum to others, of course. However, my position here is the accused. Now it's my right to give up my privacy.

By the way, I think I'm the very few students who have attended hearing with two different position: the accused and the member of Honor Council.



### Conclusion and Aftermath

The whole thing seems to be sort of unfair to me. You see, I work very hard in the project. I checked other group members' part. Also I think I'm good at this course (otherwise I won't be the TA). So I expect myself to get a high score. However, mostly due to Mai Yuqi's plagiarism, our group received a very low garde (8.5 out of 15). As a result, I do not get A+ in this course even if I get high grade in the exams (both within top ten out of 165 students). Also I'm reported to honor council and it takes me a lot of effort to justify my innocence in July.

It's really shameful for anyone, like Mai Yuqi, to plagiarize in a group project. That means this person is totally irresponsible to everything. The existence of such dishonest student makes honor code necessary.

Many of my students in VE401 this summer know more or less about the plagiarism in projects last semester. They become anxious, and about 10 students came and ask me if some behaviors will lead to honor code violation. Some students even state their concerns about probable plagiarism by teammates and ask me how to deal with such things. Of course, they don't know I'm involved in these cases too, and my emotion is quite mixed when replying to them.

**However, is such consequence the honor code expects students to be? Or is that quite opposite? I have no idea now. I feel I'm totally messed up even now.** I've already come to the university of Michigan this fall semester, and maybe I'll discuss with the honor council at UM-CoE and listen to their opinion.

**If you're the future VE401 TA , I sincerely hope you can share the whole story to your students. It's totally acceptable to redistribute this file.**



### FAQ

1. Q: Why the hearing is in July while the case happened in April?

​		A: That's because in honor council, the investigation process starts when the chair of honor council starts the process. Before that, even other members of the honor council don't know these cases.

2. Q: I've heard that Horst was still censoring plagiarism cases in July. Is that the case?

​		A: No.

3. Q: Does Horst know that he reports you to the honor council when he chose you to be the TA in VE401 SU22?

​		A: Yes. But he didn't tell me at that time. At that time very few people apply for VE401 TA, so maybe he had no choice.

4.  Q: I'm a student in VE401 SU22. Is my group found plagiarizing?

​		A: Sorry, I don't know either. The reason is similar to question 1. Of course, it's also likely that no groups are reported to honor council.

5. Q: I'll take VE401 after SU22, how to prevent plagiarism of projects due to my group members?

   A: Check others' part, keep good communication with other group members, and leave some evidence. It's recommended to use overleaf because it will be clear who's the main plagiarizer. 

6. Q: You have mentioned that at least 4 groups in SP22 are reported to the honor council. Are the result of other groups similar to your group? (That is to say, only the main plagiarizer is found guilty)

   A: Not really. I can't provide more details.
