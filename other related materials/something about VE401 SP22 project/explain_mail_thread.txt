Dear Shuyu,

based on the material that you sent me, I agree that you did your best to ensure that your team mates’s material was correct and made sense. I also agree that you actively tried to communicate with him and thereby involved yourself in that part. I furthermore believe that he actively deceived you and that you could not have known that he just copied his material from another source.

Best wishes,

Horst

The accusaton is "Section 3 of “Spring 2022 - Group 8 - Term project report.pdf” is very similar to Section 5 of “Spring 2019 - Group 17 - Term project report.pdf”". And I want to explain the situation to you.
